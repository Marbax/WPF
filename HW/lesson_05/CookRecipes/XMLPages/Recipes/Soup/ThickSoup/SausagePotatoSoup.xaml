        <Run Text=" Line a large plate with paper towel and set aside. Heat a very large pot (I recommend cast iron), over medium-high heat. Once hot, add in the sausage. Let stand without touching for 30 seconds to a minute. Then stir and crumble up the meat until you have sausage crumbles. Transfer to prepared plate and drain off any grease except for 1 tablespoon. If there is no grease that's fine, add in 1 tablespoon olive oil to the pot."/>

Stir. Add in chicken stock or broth. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium, cover with lid and cook 15-20 minutes or until the potatoes are fork tender (easily pierced with a fork)."/>
