        <Run Text="Unlike thin soups, thick soups are opaque rather than transparent. They are thickened either by adding a thickening agent, such as a roux, or by puréeing one or more of their ingredients to provide a heavier consistency. The difference between thick soup and unpassed soup is that thick soup is viscous in nature. Thick soups are further classified depending upon the thickening agents used. "/>
